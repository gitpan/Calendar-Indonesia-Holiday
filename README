DESCRIPTION
    This module provides functions to list Indonesian holidays.

    This module uses Log::Any logging framework.

    This module has Rinci metadata.

FUNCTIONS
  count_id_workdays(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]
    Count working days for a certain period.

    Working day is defined as day that is not Saturday*/Sunday/holiday/joint
    leave days*. If work_saturdays is set to true, Saturdays are also
    counted as working days. If observe_joint_leaves is set to false, joint
    leave days are also counted as working days.

    Contains data from years 2002 to 2015 (joint leave days until 2015).

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   end_date => *str*

        End date.

        Defaults to end of current month. Either a string in the form of
        "YYYY-MM-DD", or a DateTime object, is accepted.

    *   observe_joint_leaves => *bool* (default: 1)

        If set to 0, do not observe joint leave as holidays.

    *   start_date => *str*

        Starting date.

        Defaults to start of current month. Either a string in the form of
        "YYYY-MM-DD", or a DateTime object, is accepted.

    *   work_saturdays => *bool* (default: 0)

        If set to 1, Saturday is a working day.

    Return value:

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

     (any)

    leave days are also counted as working days.

FAQ
  What is "joint leave"?
    Workers are normally granted 12 days of paid leave per year. They are
    free to spend it on whichever days they want. The joint leave ("cuti
    bersama") is a government program of recent years (since 2002) to
    recommend that some of these leave days be spent together nationally on
    certain days, especially during Lebaran (Eid Ul-Fitr). It is not
    mandated, but many do follow it anyway, e.g. government civil workers,
    banks, etc. I am marking joint leave days with is_joint_leave=1 and
    is_holiday=0, while the holidays themselves with is_holiday=1, so you
    can differentiate/select both/either one.

  Holidays before 2002?
    Will be provided if there is demand and data source.

  Holidays after (current year)+1?
    Some religious holidays, especially Vesakha, are not determined yet.
    Joint leave days are also usually decreed by the government in May/June
    of the preceding year.

    Aside from national holidays, some provinces declare their own (e.g.
    governor election day for East Java province, etc).
