FAQ
  What is "joint leave"?
    Workers are normally granted 12 days of paid leave per year. They are
    free to spend it on whichever days they want. The joint leave ("cuti
    bersama") is a government program of recent years (since 2002) to
    recommend that some of these leave days be spent together nationally on
    certain days, especially during Lebaran (Eid Ul-Fitr). It is not
    mandated, but many do follow it anyway, e.g. government civil workers,
    banks, etc. I am marking joint leave days with is_joint_leave=1 and
    is_holiday=0, while the holidays themselves with is_holiday=1, so you
    can differentiate/select both/either one.

  Holidays before 2002?
    Will be provided if there is demand and data source.

  Holidays after (current year)+1?
    Some religious holidays, especially Vesakha, are not determined yet.
    Joint leave days are also usually decreed by the government in May/June
    of the preceding year.
